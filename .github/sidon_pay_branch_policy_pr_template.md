# BRANCH_POLICY.md ‚Äî SidonPay Branch & PR Playbook

> **Goal:** Keep work tidy, reviews simple, and production safe.

## üó∫Ô∏è Branch Map (who works where)

```
nc-joey  ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∂ staging-nc-joey ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∂ main
shorunmu ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∂ staging-shorunmu ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∂ main
```

- **Joey** only pushes to **`nc-joey`** and **`staging-nc-joey`**  
- **Shorunmu** only pushes to **`shorunmu`** and **`staging-shorunmu`**  
- **main** = production (PRs only; reviewed by **@Juadebfm**)

> üîí You **cannot** push to `main`. You **can** pull from `main` anytime.

---

## üß≠ Golden Rules

- ‚ùå Don‚Äôt push to `main`
- ‚úÖ Do your work on **your lane** (your personal branch)
- üîÅ Keep your branch fresh: `git pull --rebase origin main` ‚Üí resolve ‚Üí continue
- üîç Small PRs > Big PRs (easier to review, faster to ship)
- üìù PRs need a clear title, short summary, and screenshots/video if UI

---

## üë©‚Äçüíª Daily Flow (replace `<your-lane>` with your branch)

1. **Start from main (fresh):**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```
2. **Create a short-lived feature branch (recommended):**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b work/<topic>
   ```
3. **Code ‚Üí commit ‚Üí push:**
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "<area>: <concise change>"
   git push -u origin work/<topic>
   ```
4. **Open PR:** `work/<topic>` ‚Üí **`<your-lane>`**  
   (or push directly to `<your-lane>` if allowed ‚Äî PRs are preferred)
5. **Promote to staging when ready:** open PR **`<your-lane>` ‚Üí `<your-staging>`**  
   - Joey: `nc-joey` ‚Üí `staging-nc-joey`  
   - Shorunmu: `shorunmu` ‚Üí `staging-shorunmu`
6. **After review & test, promotion to prod:**  
   **@Juadebfm** opens PR **staging-<lane> ‚Üí main** and merges when green.

## üß± Keep Your Lane Updated with `main`

```bash
git checkout <your-lane>        # e.g., nc-joey or shorunmu
git pull --rebase origin main   # bring latest main on top of your work
# resolve conflicts (VS Code merge editor), then:
git push
```
> Tip: `--rebase` keeps history clean and avoids noisy merge commits.

## ‚úÖ PR Checklist (before you click ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù)

- [ ] Clear title (what & where): `payments: add receipt modal on success`
- [ ] Short description (what changed + why)
- [ ] Screenshots/GIF for UI changes
- [ ] Tests pass locally (`npm test` or your command)
- [ ] Self-reviewed the diff (nits removed, dead code gone)
- [ ] No stray `console.log`
- [ ] If backend/API affects UI, note the contract change

> The PR template below is auto-loaded for new PRs (see `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`).

---

## üß© Naming & Messages

**Branches**
- Short-lived: `work/<concise-topic>` (e.g., `work/fix-billing-form`)
- Long-lived lanes are fixed: `nc-joey`, `shorunmu`

**Commits**
- Present tense, prefix with area:
  - `auth: handle expired token on refresh`
  - `payments: create-payment route`

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Protected Branches (what to expect)

- **main**
  - PRs only, required checks, Code Owner review (**@Juadebfm**) as configured
  - Optionally require signed commits
- **staging-nc-joey / staging-shorunmu**
  - Push/PR allowed **only** by their owner + **@Juadebfm**
- **nc-joey / shorunmu**
  - Personal dev branches (owner-only + **@Juadebfm**)

If you see ‚ÄúPermission denied / Protected branch‚Äù, you‚Äôre pushing to the wrong place.

---

## üÜò Common Fixes

**‚Äúremote rejected: protected branch‚Äù**
```bash
git switch -c work/hotfix-typo
git push -u origin work/hotfix-typo
# Open PR -> your lane (nc-joey or shorunmu)
```

**‚ÄúBranch is out of date with main‚Äù**
```bash
git pull --rebase origin main
# resolve conflicts, then:
git push
```

**‚ÄúI can‚Äôt push to X branch‚Äù**
- You‚Äôre in the wrong lane. Joey can‚Äôt push to Shorunmu‚Äôs branches (and vice‚Äëversa).

---

## üîê Signed Commits (only if required)

```bash
# SSH signing (simple)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "you@example.com"
git config --global gpg.format ssh
git config --global user.signingkey "~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub"
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
# Add the public key as a "Signing key" in GitHub (Settings ‚Üí SSH and GPG keys)
```

---

## üìö Glossary

- **Lane:** your personal branch (`nc-joey` or `shorunmu`).
- **Staging:** your test/integration branch before `main`.
- **TL;DR:** ‚ÄúToo long; didn‚Äôt read‚Äù ‚Äî a short summary of the most important bits.
