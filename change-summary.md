# SidonPay – Developer Change Summary

## Features & Changes Added (Current Push)

### 1. Date Range & Calendar Filtering
- Added a **DateRangeModal** for filtering transactions by date.
- Implemented a custom **CalendarOverlay** with left/right arrow navigation for months and years.
- Date input fields now use a `dd/mm/yyyy` placeholder and match the Apply button size.

### 2. Transaction Table Filtering
- **AllTransactionsPage** now supports filtering by date range and by status (All, Successful, Uncaptured, Refunded).
- Added a filter dropdown for transaction status.
- Transactions table updates dynamically based on selected filters.

### 3. Receipt Modal Improvements
- Clicking an invoice in All Transactions or Payment Processing opens a detailed **ReceiptModal**.
- Receipt modal stretches from top to bottom of the screen on large screens, ensuring all content and buttons are visible.
- Font sizes and paddings are responsive: small screens use the original design, large screens use compact styles.
- "Download receipt" and "Done" buttons are always visible and accessible.

### 4.  Layout Fixes
- Pagination bar no longer covers table or modal content; added bottom padding to main content areas.

### 5. Payouts Page & Table
- Added a **PayoutsPage** with tabbed navigation for All, Successful, Pending, Refunded, and Failed payouts.
- Implemented **PayoutsTable** for displaying payout data with status badges and icons.
- Added sticky pagination bar at the bottom of the payouts main content.
- Filter and export buttons included for future payout data management.

### 6. General UI/UX Enhancements
- Improved responsiveness and accessibility for modals, tables, and sidebar.
